### Time Series Forecasting
Algorithm used:
1. ARIMA
2. LSTM
3. XGBoost
   
### First Dataset
ARIMA and XGBoost is trained with day.csv dataset. The model is used to predict the bike rental count based on the day.<br>

### Second Dataset
The LSTM is trained with AAPL stock prices dataset for year 2020. The traditional LSTM is used. The code will be updated with other types of LSTM such as Bidirectional LSTM, GRU, Encoder-Decoder and other models.
